STEPs for Fuzzy Membership
1. Normalize the image
2. Apply Fuzzy function to each pixel: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/spatial-analyst/fuzzy-membership.htm 
  I am leaning towards Fuzzy MS Small -> based on a specified mean and standard deviation,  smaller input values are more likely to be a member of the set
